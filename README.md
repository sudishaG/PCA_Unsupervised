PCA is a type of Unsupervised Machine Learning

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to simplify complex datasets by transforming them into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components, which capture the most significant variance in the data. Essentially, it identifies the directions of maximum variance in the data and projects it onto those axes, effectively reducing the number of variables needed to represent the data while minimizing information loss.
